* commit-check Installation Guide

** For manual use

   To get this project up and running make sure you have perl
   installed and that commit-check is somewhere in your ~PATH~.

** As git hook

   Place the commit-check executable file in the ~.git/hooks~ directory
   of your project, with the name ~commit-msg~. It doesn't need to be
   the actual executable, it can also be a (soft) link to the
   executable, or a script running this program (passing along all
   arguments).
