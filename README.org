* commit-check v0.1.0

  This is the commit-check project. It is a quick and easy commit
  style checker that can be used either as a git hook to enforce the
  style checked by commit-check, or as a syntax checker back-end (like
  [[http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Flycheck]]).

  The file [[file:INSTALL.org]] contains instructions on how to install
  commit-check on your system.

  The entire code for the project is currently contained in the
  [[file:commit-check]] file. The files [[file:test-pass.txt]],
  [[file:test-fail-barely.txt]] and [[file:test-fail-miserably.txt]] are used
  for testing purposes. They contain and explain certain situations
  that can occur when writing commits that may or may not cause errors
  to be reported.
